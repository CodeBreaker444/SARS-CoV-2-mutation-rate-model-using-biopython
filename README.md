# SARS-CoV-2-mutation-rate-model-using-biopython
'''This is not a scientific mode but a representation of it and i don't recommend it to be used for scientific purposes because this model has to be validated in real time which may take time.'''

## Things to be done
> Collect Gnome Sequences - **Done** (Only 5 countries)
> Calculate the Avg Size of 5 Genomes - **Done**
> Calculate the Pairwise score or Similarity between genomes - **Done** (Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm)
> Calculate the mutation rate by comparing the base pairs - **Done**
> Create a model for Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to accept two RNA genomes and simulate the stability - **Nope**
> Compare SARS-CoV-2 with MERS and SARS, if possible find the differentiated sequence with other strains - **Nope**
> Will be added in the future.

## Other Things
This is a project came out of curiosity and if you are expert in micro biology or molecular biology feel free raise an issue if you find anything odd.Thank you.
